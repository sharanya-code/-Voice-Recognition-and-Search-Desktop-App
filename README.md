# -Voice-Recognition-and-Search-Desktop-App
This App helps the user get information and an image using voice commands.<br />
The app has been made using Python 3.9 and using the PyCharm IDE. <br />
The App asks for an audio input from the user and then gets information based on that. <br />
I have used the SpeechRecognition Library to get user input and I have used the the Pyttsx3 Library for text to speech output.<br />
I have used the the MatPlotLib library to display the image.<br />
I have used the BeautifulSoup Library to web scrap the given information. <br />
Here is a link for the sample output for the given Program.<br />
